## Usage Examples

### Running Benchmarks
```python
from benchmarks import PolynomialBenchmarks
from fourthGen import Config

config = Config()
# Generate monomial mappings
n, d = config.n_variables, config.max_complexity * 2
index_to_monomial, monomial_to_index, _ = generate_monomials_with_additive_indices(n, d)

# Create benchmark generator
benchmarks = PolynomialBenchmarks(config, index_to_monomial, monomial_to_index)

# Get all available benchmarks
all_benchmarks = benchmarks.get_all_benchmarks()
for name, poly_sp, poly_vec in all_benchmarks:
    print(f"{name}: {poly_sp}")
```

### Using MCTS for Circuit Construction
```python
from mcts_integration import MCTSCircuitSolver, MCTSConfig
from fourthGen import CircuitBuilder, Config

# Load trained model
config = Config()
model = CircuitBuilder(config, vector_size)
# ... load model weights ...

# Create MCTS solver
mcts_config = MCTSConfig(mcts_simulations=800)
solver = MCTSCircuitSolver(model, config, mcts_config)

# Solve a polynomial
poly_sp, poly_vec = benchmarks.elementary_symmetric(2)
result = solver.solve_polynomial(poly_sp, poly_vec)
print(f"Success: {result.success}, Actions: {result.num_actions}")
```

### Comprehensive Verification
```python
from verification import verify_circuit_comprehensive

# After constructing a circuit in a Game
result = verify_circuit_comprehensive(
    game, target_poly_sp, target_poly_vec,
    config, index_to_monomial, monomial_to_index
)

print(f"Verified: {result.is_correct}")
print(f"Symbolic check: {result.symbolic_check}")
print(f"Verification time: {result.verification_time:.3f}s")
```

## Key Improvements Over Original Implementation

1. **MCTS vs Simple Tree Search**: Replaced basic top-w tree search with full MCTS including UCB selection and proper backpropagation.

2. **Structured vs Random Benchmarks**: Added well-known polynomial families (elementary symmetric, determinants, etc.) instead of only random polynomials.

3. **Comprehensive vs Basic Verification**: Multiple verification methods (symbolic, modular, floating-point) instead of just SymPy equality checks.

4. **Integration Architecture**: Unified interface for using MCTS with existing transformer models.

5. **Robust Testing**: Comprehensive test suite ensuring all components work correctly together.

## Next Steps

With these high-priority components implemented and tested, the project now has:

1. âœ… Full MCTS capability matching AlphaZero methodology
2. âœ… Standard benchmark polynomials for evaluation
3. âœ… Robust verification ensuring circuit correctness
4. âœ… Integration framework for enhanced search

The system is now ready for:
- Training with MCTS-generated self-play data
- Systematic evaluation on benchmark problems
- Comparison with classical circuit construction methods
- Scaling experiments with larger polynomial families

All implementations follow the design principles outlined in the AWS project description and provide the missing capabilities identified in the original analysis.
