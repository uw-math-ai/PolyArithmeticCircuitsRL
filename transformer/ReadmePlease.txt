1. Introduction
The initial approach involved supervised pre-training followed by a basic REINFORCE/A2C-like 
algorithm. While showing some initial learning capacity (up to 75% supervised accuracy 
on likely seen data), it failed to generalize to unseen data (2.4% test accuracy) and 
its RL phase suffered from instability and policy collapse (zero entropy, 3-4% success). 
The following major changes were implemented to address these shortcomings.


2. Core Reinforcement Learning Algorithm: PPO Implementation
The most substantial change was replacing the train_reinforce function with train_ppo, 
implementing the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm.

Rationale: PPO offers greater training stability by preventing large, potentially 
destructive policy updates and improves sample efficiency by reusing data across multiple epochs.

Key Code Changes:

New Function train_ppo: This function orchestrates the entire PPO loop.
Data Collection Loop: Gathers a large batch of experience (steps_per_batch)
 before updating. It uses torch.no_grad() during this phase.

 # In train_ppo:
model.eval()
batch_states, batch_actions, batch_old_log_probs = [], [], []
# ... other lists ...
with torch.no_grad():
    while collected_steps < config.steps_per_batch:
        # ... play one game ...
        action, log_prob, _, value = model.get_action_and_value(state_tuple, temperature=config.action_temperature)
        # ... store results ...


GAE Calculation: Implemented a new calculate_gae function for better advantage estimates.


def calculate_gae(rewards, values, dones, gamma, lambda_gae):
    advantages = []
    gae = 0.0
    values_ext = values + [values[-1] if not dones[-1] else 0.0]
    for i in reversed(range(len(rewards))):
        delta = rewards[i] + gamma * values_ext[i+1] * (1.0 - dones[i]) - values_ext[i]
        gae = delta + gamma * lambda_gae * (1.0 - dones[i]) * gae
        advantages.insert(0, gae)
    # ... calculate returns ...
    return torch.tensor(advantages, ...), torch.tensor(returns, ...)



PPO Update Loop: Iterates multiple times (ppo_epochs) over the collected data using mini-batches.


# In train_ppo:
model.train()
for epoch in range(config.ppo_epochs):
    np.random.shuffle(indices)
    for i in range(0, len(indices), config.ppo_minibatch_size):
        # ... extract minibatch ...
        # ... re-evaluate actions with current policy ...
        new_log_probs_t = torch.stack(new_log_probs)
        ratios = torch.exp(new_log_probs_t - mb_old_log_probs)

        # PPO Clipped Objective
        surr1 = ratios * mb_advantages
        surr2 = torch.clamp(ratios, 1 - config.ppo_clip, 1 + config.ppo_clip) * mb_advantages
        policy_loss = -torch.min(surr1, surr2).mean()

        # Value & Entropy Loss
        value_loss = F.mse_loss(values_pred, mb_returns)
        entropy_loss = -entropies_t.mean()

        loss = policy_loss + config.vf_coef * value_loss + config.ent_coef * entropy_loss
        # ... optimizer step ...

# In train_ppo:

    np.random.shuffle(indices)

        # ... re-evaluate actions with current policy ...
        new_log_probs_t = torch.stack(new_log_probs)
        ratios = torch.exp(new_log_probs_t - mb_old_log_probs)

        # PPO Clipped Objective
        surr1 = ratios * mb_advantages
        surr2 = torch.clamp(ratios, 1 - config.ppo_clip, 1 + config.ppo_clip) * mb_advantages
        policy_loss = -torch.min(surr1, surr2).mean()

        # Value & Entropy Loss
        value_loss = F.mse_loss(values_pred, mb_returns)
        entropy_loss = -entropies_t.mean()

        loss = policy_loss + config.vf_coef * value_loss + config.ent_coef * entropy_loss
        # ... optimizer step ...


3. Exploration Enhancements
To combat the "zero entropy" problem and ensure the model explores the vast action space.

Rationale: Without exploration, RL cannot discover new or better solutions. The original approach led to a deterministic policy.

Key Code Changes:

Temperature Scaling: Added action_temperature to Config and used it during action selection in get_action_and_value.


# In Config:
self.action_temperature = 1.5

# In get_action_and_value:
dist = Categorical(logits=valid_logits / temperature) # Softens distribution
Increased Entropy Bonus: Increased the ent_coef in Config.


# In Config:
self.ent_coef = 0.05 # Increased from 0.01

# In train_ppo loss calculation:
loss = ... + config.ent_coef * entropy_loss




4. Evaluation and Testing Framework
To get a reliable measure of the model's generalization ability.

Rationale: The original evaluation likely used seen data, giving an optimistic accuracy. Beam search provides a more robust inference method than greedy search.

Key Code Changes:

Train/Test Split: Modified the main function to create two separate CircuitDataset instances.


# In main:
train_dataset = CircuitDataset(..., size=config.train_size, description="Training")
test_dataset = CircuitDataset(..., size=config.test_size, description="Testing")
evaluate_model Update: Changed the function to accept and use the test_dataset.


# In main:
evaluate_model(model, test_dataset, config)

# In evaluate_model:
def evaluate_model(model, test_dataset, config, num_tests=500):
    # ... samples from test_dataset ...
Beam Search (in test_model.py): Replaced the original greedy decoding with a Beam Search implementation (beam_search_build_circuit).
(Code in test_model.py, not shown here, but a significant change for inference).




5. Reward Shaping
To provide more granular feedback to the RL agent.

Rationale: Sparse rewards (only at the end) make learning difficult. Adding intermediate signals can guide the agent.

Key Code Changes:

Modified compute_rewards in State.py.


# In State.py:
def compute_rewards(self):
    # ...
    rewards = [-0.1] * len(self.actions_taken) # -0.1 per step
    if success:
        rewards[-1] = 100.0 # +100 for success
    elif len(self.actions_taken) >= self.config.max_complexity:
        rewards[-1] = -10.0 # -10 for failure at max steps
    return rewards
